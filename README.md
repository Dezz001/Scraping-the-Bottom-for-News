Challenges
	With ongoing TA assistance I was unable to scrape the CNN website, therefore I scraped NYTs instead. I've created all of the route connections, GET and POST, and DOM setup, but I simply ran out of time and did not have the opportunity to fully develop my objects of scraped articles and specialized buttons.


Thanks
